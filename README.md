# list-input

Because every other spreadsheet-like form on the web sucks.

## Status

This is just a hobby project written in anger, it's not a real thing yet.

## In progress

- dropdowns
- resizable columns
	- emitting an event on resize so that you can store them in user preferences
- change detection, with an event fired when an item changes
- jank
	- field background color when checkboxes have focus
	- zeros after the decimal point on number inputs in Firefox
